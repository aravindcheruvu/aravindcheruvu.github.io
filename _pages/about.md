I am a graduate student in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech, advised by **[Dr. Danfeng Yao](https://yaogroup.cs.vt.edu/index.html)**. As a Generative AI enthusiast, my research focuses on **security and generative AI**. I am honored to have received the **Pratt Fellowship** from the CS department.

My expertise lies in conversational AI systems, particularly chatbots. I am currently investigating and mitigating toxicity in chatbots and working on model customization pipelines. My research explores attacks and defenses using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, I have experience in the Computer Vision (CV) domain, working on deepfakes, GANs, and diffusion models. 

**I am currently working as GenAI Research Intern at Samsung Research America (SRA)**. I also have 4.5 years of consulting experience, during which I worked on several large-scale projects with US-based clients. At Deloitte Consulting, I specialized as an Oracle Payroll Implementation Specialist. I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology in 2016 from VNR VJIET, Hyderabad (affiliated with JNTU), where I gained research experience in Temporal Data Mining and Network Security.

**I am looking for full-time opportunities from May 2026. If you are interested, please drop me an email.**
